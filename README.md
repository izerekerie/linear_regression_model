# üåæ AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction System

## üéØ Mission
Developing an AI-powered linear regression model to predict optimal crop yields across different regions in Africa and globally, enabling farmers and agricultural investors to make data-driven decisions about which crops to plant in specific areas based on geographic, seasonal, and production system factors. This model will help reduce agricultural investment risks, improve food security, and guide sustainable farming practices by predicting crop performance before planting.
